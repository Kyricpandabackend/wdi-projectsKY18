##WW1 flash cards!

Flash cards with interesting/facutal Q&A about world war 1!

## Introduction 
My projects main purpose is to grant a small amount of exposure for the first world war. A few tidbit questions can lead to satisfying answers. This being one my favorite subjects in history. I wanted other to become interested  in it as well. I hope this peaks your curiosity and make you go out to seek more knowledge.Here are some resources  (http://mashable.com/2016/10/23/frank-hurley-on-the-western-front/#C60uzNVFu5qF) and a free podcast series that’s highly acclaimed  (http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-50-blueprint-for-armageddon-i/)

My project is here to educate on small spectrum. On an event that rocked the whole world. 100 years later and we are still recovering from the devastation and madness that was unleashed on to the earth. Modern politics was crafted to make sure an event like this never happens again. However, it did. 30 years later ww2 casted it shadow upon the earth and polluted the world once again.  Now 78 years later we stand at the brink of another world war. That is a question of when, no longer of how.  Just with the first world war, We have brand new weapon systems that have not been used in a conventional  war and now the major power control a spectrum of each. Will the horror of 100 years ago repeat itself? We shall see….

### Issues while developing 
My main issue was really getting started. Doing a little bit of wire-framing and pseudocode helped conceptualize what I wanted to do. When I realized it I used resources to help point me in the right direction. My goal was simplicity. Making something to just do quick breeze by without many distractions.
